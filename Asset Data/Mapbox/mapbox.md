# Data Visualization Overview

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the approach for visualizing data related to our pollution assets. This data will be used to create informative visual representations, which can include charts, maps, and popups, to aid users.

## Data Visualization Requirements

### 1. **Mode of Operation and Production Size**
- **Objective**: Visualize the data based on the mode of operation of assets and their corresponding production sizes.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Mode of Operation**: Different operational states of the assets (e.g., operating, permit).
  - **Production Size**: The amount of production output, which will be represented in a visual form to show varying scales.

### 2. **Pollution Levels**
- **Objective**: Display the pollution data in conjunction with the operational and production data.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Pollution Amount**: The level of pollutants emitted during operations, which will be visually represented (e.g., color intensity, size of indicators).

### 3. **Asset Information Display**
- **Objective**: Ensure that all relevant information about the assets is accessible within the visualization.
- **Key Data Points**:
  - **Asset Name**: The name of each asset.
  - **Production Levels**: The specific amount of production output.
  - **Pollutant Concentration**: The concentration of pollutants emitted.
  - **Units of Plants**: The units associated with each site.
- **Implementation**: This information may be displayed as tooltips or popups when hovering over or clicking on the assets within the visualization.

## Future Considerations

### 1. **Chart Creation**
- **Objective**: We may want to create charts that compare and analyze data across different assets.
- **Potential Chart Types**:
  - **Bar Charts**: To compare production sizes or pollution levels between different assets.
  - **More**
