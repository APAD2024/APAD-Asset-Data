**Readme: Calculation of Air Pollution Emissions from a Coal Power Plant**

**Introduction:**
This document outlines the methodology for calculating air pollution emissions, specifically particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from a coal-fired power plant. The calculations are based on emission factors provided in various sources for coal power plants in India.

**Emission Factors:**

1. **Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10):**
   - Emissions per unit: 0.16-0.22 g/kWh for PM2.5
   - Emissions per unit: 0.29-0.45 g/kWh for PM10

2. **Sulfur Dioxide (SO2):**
   - Emissions per unit: 7.20 g/kWh

3. **Nitrogen Oxides (NOx):**
   - Emissions per unit: 4.22 to 4.38 g/kWh

**Calculation Methodology:**
To estimate the total annual emissions of each pollutant, the following steps are taken:

1. **Electricity Production Calculation:**
   Electricity production (kWh) is calculated based on the capacity of the power plant and the operating time.
   \[
   \text{Electricity Production (kWh)} = \text{Capacity (MW)} \times \text{Time (hours)}
   \]
   For example, if the power plant has a capacity of 30 MW and operates at full capacity for 24 hours a day:
   \[
   \text{Electricity Production (kWh)} = 30 \, \text{MW} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Electricity Production (kWh)} = 720 \, \text{MWh/day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Electricity Production (kWh)} = 720,000 \, \text{kWh/day}
   \]

2. **Emissions Calculation:**
   Once the electricity production is determined, emissions for each pollutant are calculated by multiplying the emissions per unit (g/kWh) by the total electricity production (kWh) and converting to tonnes per annum assuming full capacity operation for a year.

**Conclusion:**
This methodology provides a framework for estimating air pollution emissions from a coal-fired power plant based on emission factors and electricity production. The calculated emissions can be useful for environmental impact assessments and regulatory compliance evaluations.
